Notes:
- This project was generated without create-react-app scaffolding, but it uses the same react-scripts toolchain.
- If you encounter an error about blocked ports, either close the existing process or set a different port:
  set PORT=3001 && npm start   (Windows)
  PORT=3001 npm start          (macOS/Linux)
